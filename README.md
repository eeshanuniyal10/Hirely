About the Project
This application was developed as a part of my fourth-year computer science engineering studies and is a simple clone of LinkedIn’s job search feature. It provides users with a streamlined interface to browse job listings by entering relevant keywords, location, and experience level. This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Job Search: Search for jobs using keywords related to job titles, skills, or locations.
Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive UI: Modern styling and interactions using HTML and CSS.
Note: This is a front-end application, so it doesn’t include a database or backend server for dynamic data storage.

Technologies Used
HTML5 - Structure and content of the application
CSS3 - Styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6) - Interactivity and dynamic content rendering
